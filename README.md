Welcome to my submission for Task 2 of the Data Science Internship at Prodigy Infotech.
In this task, I focused on data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset structure, handle inconsistencies, and identify meaningful patterns using statistical and visualization techniques.

Dataset

Task 2: Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The dataset used for this task was provided by Prodigy Infotech as part of the internship program.
It contains a mix of numerical and categorical features, along with missing values and inconsistencies that required preprocessing before analysis.

📁 Dataset

Includes real-world data suitable for analysis

Contains missing values, duplicates, and varied data types

Used to explore relationships and distributions between features

🛠️ Tools and Libraries Used

Jupyter Notebook – Interactive data analysis and visualization

Pandas – Data cleaning, manipulation, and analysis

NumPy – Numerical operations

Matplotlib – Data visualization

Seaborn – Statistical and advanced visualizations

🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

During the EDA process, the following steps were performed:

1️⃣ Data Cleaning

Identified and handled missing values

Removed duplicate and inconsistent records

Converted data types where necessary

Ensured dataset readiness for analysis

2️⃣ Data Exploration & Visualization

Analyzed summary statistics of numerical features

Visualized data distributions using histograms and box plots

Explored relationships between variables using correlation analysis

Created bar charts, count plots, and heatmaps for deeper insights

📊 Insights

Identified key trends and patterns in the dataset

Observed correlations between important variables

Detected potential outliers and distribution imbalances

Conclusion

In conclusion, this task enhanced my understanding of data preprocessing and exploratory analysis techniques.
The insights gained through visualization and statistical analysis provide a strong foundation for future machine learning and predictive modeling tasks.

Thank you for reviewing my submission!
